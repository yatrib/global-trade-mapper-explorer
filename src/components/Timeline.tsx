        <p className="text-gray-600 text-base">The Trump administration has framed its sweeping tariff strategy as a corrective response to long-standing imbalances in global trade. The top five sources of U.S. imports â€” Mexico, Canada, China, Switzerland, and Ireland â€” collectively account for nearly half of all inbound goods, a concentration Trump argues reflects systemic unfairness. With Canada, Mexico, and China alone representing over 40% of total U.S. trade in 2024, they have become central targets in the administration's tariff campaign. The result: a turbulent series of retaliations, negotiations, and policy reversals that are redefining America's trade relationships with its most vital economic partners.	</p>
